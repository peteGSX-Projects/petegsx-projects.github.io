# DCC-EX Rotary Encoder

.. note:: 

  This code is very much in Alpha testing, documentation is almost non-existant, and much testing is needed

This software has been written to enable an Arduino with a rotary encoder connected to it to be integrated with a DCC-EX CommandStation.

The primary purpose is to select a position for a turntable via EX-RAIL automation, however it could be used for other purposes.

Initial rudimentary support for an SPI connected OLED is included.

Software requirements
=====================

In order to use this with a DCC-EX CommandStation, it must be running the "rotary-encoder" branch which is based on the current  development branch.

`EX-CommandStation rotary-encoder branch <https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX/tree/rotary-encoder>`_

Hardware requirements
=====================

This requires an AVR based Arduino (tested on a Nano), a rotary encoder (tested with a KY-040), and (optionally but recommended), an SPI connected OLED display.

Installation and configuration
==============================

The provided config.example.h should help identify the correct pins to connect the encoder and OLED to.

The default I2C address for this code is 0x80, and you will need to enable the device driver via myHal.cpp.

Example:

.. code-block:: cpp
  
  #include "IO_RotaryEncoder.h"

  void halSetup() {
    RotaryEncoder::create(700, 1, 0x80);
  }

Usage
=====

Once up and running, simply rotate the encoder to the appropriate position desired, and a push of the button will send that position to the CommandStation.

If there is a need to re-select the 0 or home position of the encoder, hold the button down for a second then release it, and the OLED display should indicate it can now be re-homed. Simply rotate the encoder to the desired home or 0 position, then press the button once to confirm.

If using an OLED, it will display the position last selected by a button press, and will also display the position reflected by the current position.

EX-RAIL automation
==================

Two EX-RAIL commands have been added to enable usage:

ONCHANGE() Event Handler
------------------------

An event handler has been added ``ONCHANGE(vpin)`` similar to the turnout and accessory event handlers.

This enables any position change of the rotary encoder to be used to define an activity.

IFRE() Test Statement
--------------------- 

A test statement ``IFRE(vpin, position)`` has been added to check for the specific position selected by the encoder.

Valid positions are from -127 to 127.

myAutomation.h Example
----------------------

This is a brief example of how to use the encoder to select some turntable positions, based on the myEX-Turntable.example.h file included with the CommandStation code:

.. code-block:: 

  // EX-Turntable macro and route definitions
  #define EX_TURNTABLE(route_id, reserve_id, vpin, steps, activity, desc) \
    ROUTE(route_id, desc) \
      RESERVE(reserve_id) \
      MOVETT(vpin, steps, activity) \
      WAITFOR(vpin) \
      FREE(reserve_id) \
      DONE

  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute1, Turntable, 600, 114, Turn, "Position 1")
  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute2, Turntable, 600, 227, Turn, "Position 2")
  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute3, Turntable, 600, 341, Turn, "Position 3")
  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute4, Turntable, 600, 2159, Turn, "Position 4")
  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute5, Turntable, 600, 2273, Turn, "Position 5")
  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute6, Turntable, 600, 2386, Turn, "Position 6")
  EX_TURNTABLE(TTRoute7, Turntable, 600, 0, Home, "Home turntable")

  // Rotary encoder event handler to select positions:
  ONCHANGE(700)
    IFRE(700, 1)
      START(TTRoute1)
    ENDIF
    IFRE(700, 2)
      START(TTRoute2)
    ENDIF
    IFRE(700, 3)
      START(TTRoute3)
    ENDIF
    IFRE(700, -1)
      START(TTRoute4)
    ENDIF
    IFRE(700, -2)
      START(TTRoute5)
    ENDIF
    IFRE(700, -3)
      START(TTRoute6)
    ENDIF
    IFRE(700, 0)
      START(TTRoute7)
    ENDIF
  DONE

  // Pre-defined aliases to ensure unique IDs are used.
  // Turntable reserve ID, valid is 0 - 255
  ALIAS(Turntable, 255)

  // Turntable ROUTE ID reservations, using <? TTRouteX> for uniqueness:
  ALIAS(TTRoute1)
  ALIAS(TTRoute2)
  ALIAS(TTRoute3)
  ALIAS(TTRoute4)
  ALIAS(TTRoute5)
  ALIAS(TTRoute6)
  ALIAS(TTRoute7)
